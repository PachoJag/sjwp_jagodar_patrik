    <p><strong>Formula One (F1)</strong> is the highest class of worldwide racing for open-wheel single-seater 
    formula racing cars sanctioned by the <em>Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</em> (FIA). 
    The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of motorsport 
    since its inaugural running in 1950 and is often considered to be the <em>pinnacle of motorsport</em>. 
    The word <em>formula</em>  in the name refers to the set of rules all participant cars must follow. 
    A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as <strong>Grands Prix.</strong> 
    Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads.
